   - The website was tested for different screen sizes and adjusted as needed.

 ### Validator testing
 * CSS: No errors were found when passing through the official [Jigsaw  validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Femese92.github.io%2Ffirst-project%2Fform.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=sv)
 * HTML: No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Femese92.github.io%2Ffirst-project%2Findex.html)


 ### Unfixed Bugs
 * On the form when choosing a date it is possible to pick past dates. I believe it is required JavaScript to fix.
 * For the form was used an anchor element for an internal link instead of form action="" method="POST", so the thank-you.html can be seen after filling in the booking fields.
