## Testing


 ### Validator testing
 * CSS: No errors were found when passing through the official [Jigsaw](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator$link) validator
 * HTML: No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Femese92.github.io%2Ffirst-project%2Findex.html)

 ### Unfixed Bugs
 * In form.html the containers with the picture and form elements are not fully centered. Therefore it also start to look a bit off when looked at it on a smaller device. Image start to "hide" behind the form element.
 * On the form when choosing a date it is possible to pick past dates. I believe it is required Javacript to fix.
